# This is the only fix for two recurring Trivy HIGHs. pip ships a vendored
# dependency set (see pip/_vendor/vendor.txt) that Trivy scans as real packages:
# msgpack 1.1.2 (GHSA-6v7p-g79w-8964) and setuptools 70.3.0 (CVE-2025-47273).
# Neither is an application dependency, so no lockfile change can move them, and
# no pip release ships fixed versions. Removing the unused component is the fix.
