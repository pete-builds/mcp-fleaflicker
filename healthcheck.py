"""Health check script for Docker HEALTHCHECK.

Wraps ``pete_mcp_core.healthcheck.check`` so the probe targets ``/healthz``,
never ``/mcp``.

A bare ``GET /mcp`` makes the MCP SDK create a transport session *before*
returning 406, and nothing reaps it — roughly 40 KB leaked per request,
measured. At a 30s interval that is 2,880 probes a day, about 115 MiB/day of
permanently leaked memory on a server meant to run unattended for years. The
HTTP verb is not a workaround: the session is created before method dispatch,
so HEAD and OPTIONS leak slightly worse than GET. Only staying off the ``/mcp``
mount avoids it. ``/healthz`` is a plain custom route with no session cost.

401 is treated as alive because with ``MCP_AUTH_REQUIRED=true`` an
unauthenticated probe is rejected by a server that is otherwise serving
perfectly. 500 stays out: a real fault must still fail.

Env precedence for the port matches ``pete_mcp_core.serve`` exactly
(``FASTMCP_PORT`` > ``MCP_PORT`` > default) so the probe can never target a
different port than the server.
